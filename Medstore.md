## Medstore

Medstore is a UI design for a medicine store's self-ordering kiosk, where customers can order the products they needed through the self-ordering kiosks placed in front of the store. After confirming the order, the customer can go to the cashier to pay and grab the ordered products. Medstore was designed for Multimedia Systems course's mid exam in the fourth semester.

The self-ordering kiosk's UI design consist of four different pages.
1. Promotion page

The promotion page displays ads, discounts, or promotions that Medstore has to offer to their customers. The promotion page runs everytime the kiosk is idle or not used by a customer. The page's design can be seen below.

2. Home page

The home page displays all the products based on their categories. The customer can browse through the display and order their desired items. When the customer wants to check out or order the products, the customer needs to press "View Your Cart" button, which will direct the customer to the payment page. The page's design can be seen below.
