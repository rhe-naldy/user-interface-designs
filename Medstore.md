## Medstore

Medstore is a UI design for a medicine store's self-ordering kiosk, where customers can order the products they needed through the self-ordering kiosks placed in front of the store. After confirming the order, the customer can go to the cashier to pay and grab the ordered products. Medstore was designed for Multimedia Systems course's mid exam in the fourth semester.

The self-ordering kiosk's UI design consist of four different pages.
1. Promotion page
